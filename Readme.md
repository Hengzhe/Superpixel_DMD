## Multi-color superpixel method 
The code is for our paper published in Optics Express: [Multi-color complex spatial light modulation with a single digital micromirror device](https://opg.optica.org/oe/abstract.cfm?doi=10.1364/OE.494238)

We generalize the previous proposed superpixel method into a multi-color regime. Based on this generalized method, we demonstrated 3-color multi-plane holographic projection, and 2-color Airy beam generation. One can easily simulate those results with the code.
